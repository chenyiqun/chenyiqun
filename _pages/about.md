My name is **Yiqun Chen** (陈逸群). Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), Renmin University of China (RUC), under the guidance of Prof. [Jiaxin Mao](https://sites.google.com/site/maojiaxin/). 

Before this, I earned my Master’s degree from the **Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)**, and my Bachelor’s degree from **Shandong University (SDU)**.

Beyond academic research, I actively participate in collaborative projects with leading internet companies, focusing on the construction and optimization of **Search Agents** and **LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems**.

**📢 I am actively seeking a Research Internship for Spring 2026.** If you are interested in my research background or potential collaborations, please feel free to contact me!

### Research Interests

My research interests primarily lie in **AI Search**, **Information Retrieval**, and **Reinforcement Learning**:

* **AI Search**: 
    * Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    * Agentic Search & Deep Research
* **Information Retrieval (IR)**: 
    * Large Language Models for Ranking (LLM4Ranking)
    * Search Result Diversification (SRD)
    * Application of Reinforcement Learning for IR
* **Reinforcement Learning**: 
    * Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
