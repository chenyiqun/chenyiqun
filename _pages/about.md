My name is **Yiqun Chen** (陈逸群). Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), Renmin University of China (RUC), under the guidance of Prof. [Jiaxin Mao](https://sites.google.com/site/maojiaxin/).

### 🏢 Industry Collaboration & Leadership

Beyond academic research, I maintain close collaborations with leading tech giants. My track record includes impactful projects with:
* **Baidu** (Search Dept. & Intelligent Cloud)
* **XiaoHongShu** (AI Search)
* **ByteDance** (Feishu)

My work primarily focuses on **Search Agents** and the optimization of **LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems**. 

🚀 **From Contributor to Leader**: Throughout these projects, my role has evolved from a core contributor to a **Team Lead**. This journey has equipped me with extensive practical experience in RL for model training, system design, and cross-team collaboration. 

✨ *Stay tuned! A wave of exciting research results and products from these collaborations will be released soon.*

### 👨‍🎓 Job Market: Fall 2026 Internship

As a prospective Ph.D. graduate (Class of 2027), I am actively seeking a **Fall 2026 Internship** (targeting the 2027 campus recruitment season).

🤝 **Why me?** My mission is to build **robust, scalable Multi-Agent paradigms and efficient training methodologies**. I prioritize **practical utility over theoretical narratives** (rejecting mere "storytelling"). I am dedicated to bringing **tangible performance gains** and **genuine, deployable innovation** to industrial scenarios.

If you are looking for a researcher who focuses on **what actually works**, please **contact me**!
